#Cogulator
A Cognitive Modeling Calculator  
[cogulator.io](http://cogulator.io)

Cogulator, a portmanteau of Cognitive and Calculator, is a simple tool for task analysis and GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules) modeling. It's designed to be approachable for new users and quick for experienced ones. To that end, Cogulator has a fairly limited feature set. You describe the task using CMN-GOMS (discussed more later) and Cogulator returns task time predictions and working memory load estimates. Anything that gets in the way of those basic tasks has been eliminated. In fact, even the “S” in GOMS isn’t spared - there are no selection rules available in Cogulator. In short, we have tried to create a tightly focused application for building GOMS models by applying basic human factors to a basic human factors tool.

#License
Cogulator is provided gratis under an Apache 2.0 license. Feel free to look under the hood or pull the code. If you’d like to contribute to the project, get in touch. Cogulator is developed in Flash CS6 and deployed as an Air application.

#Beta
This is beta software: don’t use Cogulator for critical work. Make sure your models folder (Documents/cogulator/models) is backed up regularly. 

#Alternatives
If Cogulator doesn't work for your purposes (say, you wanted to plug into a sim or want to build models graphically), consider some of these alternatives
