To simulate working memory load, Cogulator adds chunks to working memory each time certain operators are used. Those operators include: Store, Recall, Look, Search, Perceptual_processor, Listen, or Think. Store can also be used to explicitly force a chunk into working memory. In this example, we model someone adding two, three digit numbers in their head. Each chunk added to working memory is represented as a colored block in the Gantt chart. Over time, those memories begin to decay, until they're no longer accessible. That decay is symbolized in the chart with the use of transparency - the blocks becoming more and more translucent until they leave memory altogether.
