       <description>A bunch of new features, including: Magic Models, Selection Rules, a Methods sidebar, new touchscreen operators, and more.  Be advised, on first run of the new release, Cogulator will update your operators.txt file.  Just to be safe, it will create a backup (saved at Documents/cogulator/operators) of your current operators.txt file. Check out http://cogulator.io for more info.</description>
